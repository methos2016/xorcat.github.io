I'm an IT worker living in Brisbane. I'm currently working in Networking and Engineering at a small consulting startup in Brisbane.

Currently at work, I am working with Cisco equipment, which is my main professional background, however I am studying all kinds of things in my free time, such as *(at the time of writing)*:

*   Malware analysis (reading [Practical Malware Analysis](https://practicalmalwareanalysis.com/)
*   Penetration testing (working on random CTFs and [Vulnhub](https://vulnhub.com) VMs)
*   Data science (beginning with [Microsoft's courses on EdX](https://www.edx.org/microsoft-professional-program-certficate-data-science))
*   General computer science topics (beginning with [MIT's CS50x on EdX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x))

I do not want to limit this website, I envisage writing about all kinds of things, from things that I study about, things that happen at work, and just things that I want to get off of my chest.

I'm **always** open to feedback. If you've got anything at all you'd like to say to me, you can find me at **[@XORcat on Twitter](https://twitter.com/xorcat)**, and through **[email](mailto:xorcat@riseup.net)**.
If you've got something that you want to keep private, you can use my **[PGP key](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xF2D050D3A528A62C)** to ensure it is only read by me.
